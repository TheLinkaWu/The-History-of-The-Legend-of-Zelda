# The Legend of Zelda
The Legend of Zelda is one of the modern examples of great Nintendo figures. The series has grown so greatly it just needs a review of
its history. In the 1980s, when the NES was released, a game franchise was born. The Legend of Zelda came out and it was amazing. The
game was an open world for you to have on your own. It had no real story within the game and you were simply a green dude that goes to in
dungeons to collect triangles to stop a giant pig man. However, this game was based off the feeling Shigareu Miyamoto had as a child when
he wanted to explore caves as a child. This then was turned into a game that was loved by many and created a franchise. However, in later
games there was a change in soul for the franchise. The games started to become more centered on the items that were found rather than 
the adventure of finding them. There was also a shift of focus on what you should care about in a Legend of Zelda game. It changed from 
traveling around the world and finding cool swords into caring about your job as a hero to save the world. Back to the original Legend of
Zelda, there was a large amount of difficulty in the game. It was insanely rutheless to the point where if you died, you had to restart 
from the beginning of a dungeon. This game would have had an amazing fighting system if it had a more complex fighting system. However, 
it was as simple as point and hit. There isn't much more to say on the gameplay or story of the Legend of Zelda, so I will leave it off
here.
